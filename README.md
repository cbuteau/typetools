# typetools

## Concept

A port of typecodes to ES6
I did a lot of work and testing of typecodes and no one used it.
Maybe if I port the work to es6 someone will.

TO write and test in ES6.


## Design

The design will use multiple modules imported to make management of the code easier.


## Status

### 8/15/2020

SO far can't get tests to run.
everything seems to think I want to transpile when I do not.
This was kind of close.
